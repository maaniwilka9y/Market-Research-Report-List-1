<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers</li><li>External Cardiac Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pacemaker market comprises two primary types: implantable cardiac pacemakers and external cardiac pacemakers. Implantable cardiac pacemakers are surgically inserted devices that regulate heartbeats in patients with arrhythmias, offering long-term management. These devices can be further classified into single-chamber, dual-chamber, and biventricular types. In contrast, external cardiac pacemakers are temporary devices used during emergencies or specific medical interventions. They provide immediate pacing support without surgical implantation, typically in critical care or operating room settings.</p></p>
