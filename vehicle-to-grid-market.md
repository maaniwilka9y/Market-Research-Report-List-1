<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle to Grid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional V2G</li><li>Bidirectional V2G</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology enables electric vehicles (EVs) to interact with the power grid. Unidirectional V2G allows EVs to discharge energy back to the grid solely during peak demand, thus supporting grid stability without receiving energy in return. Conversely, Bidirectional V2G facilitates two-way energy flow, allowing EVs to both send energy back and receive it, enabling greater flexibility and optimizing energy usage. Both market types enhance grid efficiency and promote renewable energy usage, aiding in energy management.</p></p>
