<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Economizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid/ Water Side Economizer</li><li>Air Side Economizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Economizers optimize energy efficiency in HVAC systems by utilizing ambient conditions. Fluid or water-side economizers leverage external water sources, like chilled water from a cooling tower, to enhance system efficiency. They reduce energy consumption by enabling cooling without running chillers. Air-side economizers, on the other hand, use outside air to cool indoor spaces, minimizing reliance on mechanical cooling. Both types contribute to lower operational costs and improved sustainability in commercial buildings, highlighting their importance in energy-efficient design.</p></p>
