<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Protection Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-purifying Respirators</li><li>Supplied Air Respirators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The respiratory protection equipment market is primarily divided into two types: air-purifying respirators (APRs) and supplied air respirators (SARs). APRs filter out harmful substances from the air, using filters, cartridges, or canisters, making them suitable for environments where airborne contaminants are present. In contrast, SARs provide clean, breathable air from a separate source, ideal for oxygen-deficient or highly contaminated environments. Both types are crucial for ensuring worker safety in industrial, healthcare, and emergency response settings.</p></p>
