<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Retractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hand Held Retractors</li><li>Self-Retaining Retractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical retractor market is primarily divided into two types: hand-held retractors and self-retaining retractors. Hand-held retractors require manual operation by a surgeon or assistant to maintain tissue positioning during procedures, offering precision and control. In contrast, self-retaining retractors are designed with mechanisms that hold themselves in place, allowing for hands-free use. This enhances surgical efficiency and provides better visibility for the operating team. Both types play crucial roles in a variety of surgical specialties, ensuring patient safety and procedural effectiveness.</p></p>
